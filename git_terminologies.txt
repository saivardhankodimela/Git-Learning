- Initialising a Repo (git init)
- Checking the status (git status)
- add the files to Git's tracking system (git add <filename or directory>)
  ( git add . ) => stages all untracked changes. 
- Staging area: This is a preview area, where you can either continue to commit or remove it before commiting.
- remove from staging area ( git rm --cached <file>...)
- Diff : Looking into changes of the current file. (git diff)
  == after tracking the files/ staging we cannot find the diff if we want the diff then we use
- cached Diff : for checking the difference of added files (git diff --cached)
- commiting the chages (git commit -m "message of commit")
- commit log: What all changes you and your team has made (git log)
